# Tooltip macro for XWiki

Displays contextual information in a tooltip, when the user clicks or passes his mouse over a word or a sentence.

## Installation

You can either install the latest version using the [Extension Manager](http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/Extension/Extension+Manager+Application) (search for `tooltip`), or build a snapshot from the sources and install it using the [XAR import](http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/AdminGuide/ImportExport).

## Building

This application is built using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). Once Maven is installed, simply execute `mvn install`, which will generate a XAR file in the `target` subdirectory.
